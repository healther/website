        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p style="text-align: left">
            This homepage was initially the result of a week of sick leave and the resulting boredom in 2018. I subsequently extended it in a series of train and airplane travels, when I wasn't motivated to do actual work.
            It is hosted on <a href="https://www.baumbach.pw">www.baumbach.pw</a> and should offer https. If it doesn't please let me know.
            Whoever finds it is free to enjoy and do whatever (s)he wants with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't claim copyright to any of this and as I've done (at least up to now, so when you read it it will probably be out of date) everything myself, there shouldn't be any violations of any kind on this homepage.
            Again if it doesn't please let me know.
        </p>

            For purely private websites it doesn't seem to be required to put up an Impressum (yes I'm based in Germany), so I think this is good without it. If you seem to think that I'm wrong, please let me know at webmaster&lt;at&gt;baumbach.pw .
